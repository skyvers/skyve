    - Obey security restrictions
    - Non-persistent attribute projection and query engine knows how to retrieve
    - No instantiation unless absolutely necessary
        - Results are Maps that expose the domain interface, until real bean is required
    - Paging filtering sorting joining built in

    - Declare hibernate second level caches and assign to document metadata
    - Conversations cached
- Conversation state-based UIs
- Isomorphic rendering
- Project generation
- UI interpretation
- Multiple rendering pipelines
- Plugin architecture
- Drillable data intensive UIs

    - Selenese or Web Driver
- Plugable converters/validators
- Unit test generation
    - CRUD Domain testing
    - Action tests
    - Test data generation
    - Data store test data seeding.
- Background UI task
    - A ViewBackgroundTask is a short-running asynchronous process that can be kicked off via WebContext (no percent complete or interrupt method)
    - It is applicable to the UI and has access to and the ability to control the conversation caching in its execution via cacheConversation().
    - It continues to use the Persistence instance from the conversation with all the state as if it was another user gesture - same level 1 cache, same local UI mutations.
    - Itâ€™s execute method takes the current contextual bean and is never null - ie it has UI context.
    - The persistence is set as async for the thread so that aysnc timeouts are used during its execution similar to Jobs though.
- Push tech
- User Agent Sniffing in router
- JS API and inject
- XHTML off the reservation Page routing.
- Charting
    - Metadata definition
    - Programmatic charting
    - JS and server-side
- Jobs
    - A Job represents an asynchronous process that can be scheduled or run ad-hoc.
    - It is registered against a module and available to be scheduled through the UI.
    - Although job logging can be turned off for a Job, each run is generally logged.
    - The persistence is set as async for the thread so that aysnc timeouts are used during its execution.
